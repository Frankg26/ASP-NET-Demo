# ASP-NET-Demo

ASP.NET Demo Version 1.0

This is a demo that shows a couple of the libraries I have worked with for ASP.NET MVC. In all the pages you will see JavaScript and CSHTML work for the view and C# on the controller for "querying" data and simple models. The "data querys" are just dummy data, but it is handled as if they had come out from a data base.
